Open issues (version 1.2-7):

1. Uncovered instrument clusters from Fabia, Ibiza, Roomster, T5 released from end of 2006
2. For following cars not implemented automatic change of odometer (R/W eeprom works):
  - VW Sharan (all types HC11, two versions from VDO)
  - Magneti Marelli (inside HC908)
For these vehicles is recommended manual calculation of odometer value/login
3. User interface problems
4. Because of problems with checksum calculation automatic change of odometer for visteon instrument cluster disabled 
   -> user needs to perfom manual changes inside of eeprom (custom memory access). Please be careful with this car and don't change EEPROM if is not clear chacksum calculations!!!
